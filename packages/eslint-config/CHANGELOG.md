### Patch Changes

- `/api/status` now carries `llm.mode`, which `reportProvidersMode(pool)` writes at worker boot
  (migration 0008), and `hf doctor` warns when an app is serving fixture drafts. The CLI gained the
  cloud `hf new` path, `hf doctor` and `hf restore-check`, with the SSH runner and provisioning
  behind them; a child that exits before reading its stdin no longer fails a run with `EPIPE`, and
  `hf_score` names the spec it scored.

## 0.1.0
